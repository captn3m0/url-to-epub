General ideas for improvement of the script:

1. Support multiple authors
2. Support no cover image
3. Support generic generated cover images
4. Remove pandoc dependency
5. Optionally support <https://github.com/mozilla/readability> instead of article-parser. Mozilla's engine is much better.
6. Add more EPUB metadata tag support
7. Pick up the language automatically
8. Better error message without pandoc
